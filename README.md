# Automation-of-Society-Security-Task
## Problem Statement 
Automation of Society Security Tasks – Visitors in a housing society fall in the category of regular visitors like drivers, maids, milkman, sweeper, car cleaners, etc who visit on a daily basis and the other category is of infrequent known or unknown visitors ( like guests, delivery boys). Record with timestamp registered regular visitors and their temperature check.
* Make housing societies more secure.
* Visitors ➡ Regular and Irregular
* Registered Regular Visitors ➡ Automatic recording using continuous camera feed ➡ timestamp and temperature 
* Accurate face recognition by considering visual changes 
* Daily report generation
=> Assumptions: 
    Visitors arriving one-by-one
    Continuous power supply and WiFi available to Raspberry Pi
    Any mobile like device is available with watchman
## Proposed Solution
* Hierarchy of users with different access rights
* Camera module and contactless temperature sensor mounted on a single device(Raspberry Pi) ➡ ensures automatic synchronization
* Efficient face recognition using AWS Face Rekognition API
* Increases incident response and resolution time.
* Temperature data analysis to trace any Covid-19 cases.
* Handling irregular visitors seamlessly
